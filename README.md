HttpRequest for legacy app.
=====

This is a reimplementation of PEAR::HTTP_Request using Guzzle.

## IMPORTANT NOTE

It is intended to extend the life of old PHP applications and is not a library to be actively used.

It is not for new projects, I recommend to use well-maintained modern libraries (such as Symfony HttpClient) instead of this legacy implementation.

## CAUTION

- This library is NOT perfect compatibility with PEAR::HTTP_Request.

## Requirements

- PHP 7.2 or higher (maybe)
